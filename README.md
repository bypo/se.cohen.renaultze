# RenaultZE - Handle your Renault Zoe in Homey

Add support to check status on your Renault Zoe or Megane E-tech and handle pre-heating.
Should work on these, but only tested with "ZOE phase 2".
* ZOE phase 1 (X101VE)
* ZOE phase 2 (X102VE)
* MEGANE E-TECH (XCB1VE)

You need to have an active and working account, if it works in your normal Renault App - it should work here too, use the credentials you have and during paring select the vehicle you want to pair with help by the VIN-number.

Note that the app is built on the unofficial Renault API and it can change without notice and stop working, if changes happen I will try to act quick to follow the changes.

Thanks to the guys behind these projects and blogs to help figure out how the Renault API works (or do not work):
